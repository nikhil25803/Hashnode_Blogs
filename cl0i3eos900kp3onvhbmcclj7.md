> ### The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines

You will find this quote written beside the logo of Django on its official website, but is it justified? Allow me to give it a try, so first of all...

## What is Django?
Django, pronounced as "Jango" is a free open-source web framework that helps developers to make fast, scalable, versatile, and secure websites. It was publicly released in 2005 and is maintained by [ Django Software Foundation ](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/). It was named after the famous jazz guitarist [ Django Reinhardt ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Reinhardt)

## Why choose Django?
####  Fast  🚀
+ Django has its own markup language which helps perform operations on templates like rendering, looping, and even conditions that can be written to render a template. These templates can be static and dynamic too!

+ It has its own model form library that helps to take user input with the help of HTML input fields and that data from the database can be used to perform logical operations

+ Django works on the principle of the "Don't repeat yourself" concept, it contains the generic view i.e the Python functions which enable us to write less code that makes our project lightweight.

#### Preloaded Functionality 🤝
+ Django is completely loaded with functionalities like authentication, administration, ORM, forms, database migrations, etc.

+ Django has both the concept of authentication and authorization. Authentication means to verify the user whereas authorization determines what that authenticated user is allowed to do.

+ User can be registered using the Django admin panel and even a HTML form can be used to inject user credentials into the database.

+ For authorization, Django has Permissions, a Binary (yes/no) flags system, and Groups, which is a generic way to give permissions to more than one user. 

#### Secure 🔐
+ Django helps use to fight against cyberattacks like
 + **SQL Injection**, in which the hacker uses SQL (Structured Query Language ) to manipulate the database and can delete or leak the valuable information
 + **Clickjacking** is a kind of cyber attack in which the hacker tricks the user thinks that they are clicking on one thing but they are actually clicking on something else.
 + **CSRF(Cross-Site Request Forgery)** attack, where the hackers perform an action using the credentials of the user without his/her concern. In most the case it is fetched by the cookies in the browser

#### Scalable Projects 📈
+ Many content management, social networks, and scientific computation based projects can be built on Django

+ Social media apps like **Instagram** and **Pinterest** are built with Django which are is undoubtedly the world’s most famous as well as a fast-growing social network.

+  **YouTube** was originally built with PHP but the increasing number of the audience made them necessary for YouTube to join the Django community.

+ **Spotify**, one of the fastest and one of the most demanding apps to listen to millions of songs in a simple application is done with the use of Django.

+ **Dropbox**, one of the most famous cloud-based storage apps for videos, graphics, documents, etc is using Django.

+ Even **Mozilla**, a famous browser was originally started out using PHP along with CakePHP but due to the growing demand, the team decided to switch to Python and Django. 

+ **The Washington Post**, **The Guardian**, and **The New York Post** which are the most popular news sites in the world that are reportedly using Django for their online platform
